	  <h1>Spectrum Filter - Accessible Editor - Prototype 2</h1>
    <p>
      This prototype replicates the functionality of the Neuro Desktop Editor
      to interact with and change the settings of the Spectrum Intellingent Filter.
      The prototype provides most of the functionality of the original editor. A few settings
      are missing and some have only partial functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the editor, change the "groups" dropdown (accesskey g) to choose which group of settings
      you want to change. Based on this group, a set of dropdowns, checkboxes, and/or value setters will appear.
      When the Spectrum Filter is connected to your computer via USB, changing these elements will automatically
      change the corresponding setting on the Filter. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this prototype to burn and load presets (accesskey p). Burning a preset to a particular
      number saves the current settings on the Filter to the preset of that number. Loading a preset with a
      particular number changes the current settings on the Filter to match the settings of the preset.
